# ðŸ’» Gamescreen for BiteMe

##BiteMe
BiteMe is a multiplayer snake game

## Start
`bash
npm start
`

## Basic design

## Tech stack
- React, Typescript

## Architecture
### States

#### Counter
- type: `number`
- ensures that the game renders at each tick rather than at change of other states
- 

#### Players
```ts
type TDirections = 'UP' | 'DOWN' | 'RIGHT' | 'LEFT';

interface IPlayerSchema {
    direction: TDirections,
    color: string,
    playerId: string,
    screenId: string,
    name: string,
    toGrow: number,
    __typename: string,
}

interface IRealTimeData {
    data: {
        onPositionUpdated: IPlayerSchema
    }
}
```
- stores all players that ever joined the game, does not delete the ones that died
- allows for them to rejoin without the need to refresh the controller (`playerId` stays the same);

#### Positions
```ts
export interface IPositionSchema {
    row: number,
    col: number,
}

export interface IAllPositions {
    [key: string] : IPositionSchema[],
}
```
- most up-to-date position of all active players and the snakes
- snake body is an array of coordinates

#### Foods
- type: `IPositionSchema[]`
- most up-to-date position of all foods

#### Board
- type: `(string | null)[][]`
- abstract representation of the board in the form of array of arrays (rows and cols)
- if there is `food = 'FOOD'`
- if there is `player = ${playerId}`

## Rules
- amount of food will be always same or more than number of players
- there are only 3 directions a snake can go (forward, left, right; no backwards)
- minimal length of snakes is 3 cells
